I added support for the author meta tag. If a webpage includes: `<meta name="author" content="Author Name">`, The server extracts it.

Test webpage:

I made changes to the visual of the preview box with the following changes:
- Rounded Corners: Added border-radius to the preview box to create a softer, modern look
- Box Shadow: Added box-shadow to give the preview box a sense of depth
- Image Styling: Rounded image corners slightly to visually match the overall rounded container
